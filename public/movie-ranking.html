<h1>My top 5 movie that i have watched!</h1>
<h2>Note : This is just my personal opinion, etc etc</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Ritual 2001</h3>
<p>Really liked that movie, <br>
for some reason the aesthetic is just what i want out of a movie like that, very surreal, very good watch for weird people like me</p>

<h3>Grand budapest hotel</h3>
<p> This is also really good <br>
The aesthetic again, really sells it. If its just a movie that are boring to watch, i dont even think it would be that interesting</p>

<h3>Handmaiden</h3>
<p>A good movie barely disguised as a lesbian porn movie <br>
While that is partly a jokes, the plot twist on those movie is insane. The story is also amazing to watch</p>
